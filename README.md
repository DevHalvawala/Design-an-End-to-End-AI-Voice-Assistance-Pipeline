# Design-an-End-to-End-AI-Voice-Assistance-Pipeline
Design a pipeline that takes a voice query command, converts it into text, uses a LLM to generate a response, and then converts the output text back into speech. The system should have low latency, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), restrict the output to 2 sentences, and allow for tunable parameters such as pitch, male/female voice, and speed.
